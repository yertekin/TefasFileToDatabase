TefasFileToDatabase Project Details

Hello everybody!
This basic java project's aim is a standard csv to db data transfer.

Tefas is the government based Investing Fund Platform in Turkey.
As an investor, I'd like to see my fund's performance daily, weekly etc.
My bank and Tefas provide graphics but they're not personalised.

Tefas shares investment fund's daily records, but they don't have a public API.
Thus, in order to code my personalised dashboard, I need to import the data I need from Tefas website.
Thankfully, they provide data in csv format. 
In this project, I'll take that csv manually and parse it to my MySql database.

Tefas website that I'll use as source csv:
